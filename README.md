# ZHTP (Zero-Knowledge Hidden Transport Protocol)

ZHTP is a next-generation internet protocol that combines post-quantum cryptography with zero-knowledge proofs to enable fully private and hidden communication channels for decentralized applications.

## Features

### üîí Post-Quantum Security
- Kyber-768 for key encapsulation
- Dilithium2 for digital signatures
- Future-proof against quantum computer attacks

### üïµÔ∏è Zero-Knowledge Privacy
- Hidden routing paths with ZK-SNARKs
- Plonk proving system
- Verifiable but private state transitions
- Complete sender/receiver anonymity

### üåê Decentralized Architecture
- Peer-to-peer networking
- DHT-based hidden content addressing
- Byzantine fault tolerant consensus
- No central authorities or tracking

### üì± Browser Integration
- Native WASM support
- True private browsing
- Hidden decentralized applications
