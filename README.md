# ZHTP Protocol - Zero-Knowledge HTTP Replacement

🚀 **A complete quantum-resistant, zero-knowledge replacement for HTTPS with blockchain rewards**

## 🌟 What is ZHTP?

ZHTP (Zero-Knowledge HTTP) is a revolutionary decentralized internet protocol that completely replaces traditional HTTPS with:

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Every transaction, routing decision, and storage operation uses ZK proofs
- **🛡️ Quantum-Resistant Cryptography** - Post-quantum secure (Dilithium, Kyber, BLAKE3)
- **💰 Blockchain Rewards** - Earn ZHTP tokens for generating ZK proofs and securing the network
- **🌐 Native Browser Support** - Use `zhtp://` URLs directly in your browser
- **🔐 Persistent ZK Identity** - Your identity and wallet are secured by zero-knowledge cryptography

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

```
🎊 ZHTP PRODUCTION NETWORK STATUS:
├── 🔬 Zero-Knowledge Pipeline: ACTIVE
├── 💰 Blockchain Rewards System: OPERATIONAL  
├── 🛡️ ZK Storage Proofs: VERIFIED
├── 🚀 ZK Routing Proofs: ACTIVE
├── 🌐 ZHTP Protocol Server: LISTENING (Port 8000)
├── 📡 Network Service: PROCESSING BLOCKS
└── 🏛️ All 6 ZK Circuits: COMPILED & VERIFIED
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **🔗 ZK Consensus Engine** - Proof-of-stake with zero-knowledge stake proofs
- **🛣️ Anonymous Routing** - ZK proofs hide routing paths and node identities  
- **🗄️ Verified Storage** - Integrity proofs ensure data authenticity
- **🏛️ DAO Governance** - Anonymous voting with ZK proofs
- **🌐 Decentralized DNS** - `.zhtp` domains with ownership proofs
- **💱 DApp Launchpad** - Deploy decentralized applications

### ZK Circuit Infrastructure
All protocols use **compiled ZK circuits** for verification:

| Circuit | Constraints | Purpose | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `consensus/stake_proof.r1cs` | 195 | Validator stake verification | ✅ Active |
| `transactions/private_transfer.r1cs` | 8 | Private transactions | ✅ Active |
| `storage/integrity_proof.r1cs` | 10 | Storage verification | ✅ Active |
| `dao/anonymous_voting.r1cs` | 15 | Anonymous governance | ✅ Active |
| `dns/ownership_proof.r1cs` | 10 | Domain ownership | ✅ Active |
| `routing/routing_proof.r1cs` | 14 | Anonymous routing | ✅ Active |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **Circom** (for ZK circuits)
- **Node.js** (for circuit compilation)

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ZHTP-main

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Start the ZHTP Network

```bash
# Start the network service (runs blockchain, consensus, DNS, etc.)
./target/release/network-service.exe
```

You should see:

📋 Using COMPILED ZK Circuits:
  ✅ consensus/stake_proof.r1cs (195 constraints)
  ✅ transactions/private_transfer.r1cs (8 constraints)
  ✅ storage/integrity_proof.r1cs (10 constraints)
  ✅ dao/anonymous_voting.r1cs (15 constraints)
  ✅ dns/ownership_proof.r1cs (10 constraints)
  ✅ routing/routing_proof.r1cs (14 constraints)
🌐 ZHTP Protocol Server listening on port 8000
```

### 3. Test Browser Integration

Open in your browser:
- **Main Interface**: `file:///C:/Users/sethr/Desktop/ZHTP-main/browser/index.html`
- **Whisper App**: `file:///C:/Users/sethr/Desktop/ZHTP-main/browser/whisper.html`

The browser will automatically:
- Generate a persistent ZK identity
- Connect to the ZHTP network on localhost:8000
- Enable `zhtp://whisper.zhtp` protocol support

## 🔬 ZK Circuit Development

### Compiled Circuits Location
```
circuits/compiled/
├── consensus/stake_proof.r1cs
├── transactions/private_transfer.r1cs  
├── storage/integrity_proof.r1cs
├── dao/anonymous_voting.r1cs
├── dns/ownership_proof.r1cs
└── routing/routing_proof.r1cs
```

### Adding New Circuits
1. Create circuit in `circuits/src/your_component/`
2. Compile: `circom your_circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --output compiled/your_component/`
3. Integrate in Rust code via the ZK engine

### Circuit Verification
All circuits use **real constraint systems** with **cryptographically secure verification**! 

🔒 **SECURITY GUARANTEE**: Every ZK proof is verified against compiled `.r1cs` files using:
- **Real PLONK/SNARK verification** with polynomial constraints
- **Secure KZG commitments** with cryptographically random secrets  
- **Complete constraint validation** - NO bypasses or shortcuts allowed
- **Pairing-based verification** for zero-knowledge properties

⚠️ **FIXED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**:
- ✅ **Eliminated hardcoded secrets** in KZG commitments
- ✅ **Implemented real polynomial verification** instead of hash comparisons  
- ✅ **Removed verification bypasses** - all proofs must be complete
- ✅ **Added proper PLONK constraint checking** with secure randomness

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Errors
```bash
# If you get circuit compilation errors:
npm install -g circom
circom --version  # Should show 2.0+

# If Rust build fails:
